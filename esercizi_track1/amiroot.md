# Explanation of the script : 'amiroot?'

This Bash script checks whether the current user executing the script is the root user or a regular user. 

In Linux systems, the root user is the system administrator with full privileges. 
This script verifies the user's identity by comparing the current User ID (UID) or username to that of root. 

#!/bin/bash specifies that the script should be executed using the bash interpreter.

ROOT_UID=0 : the root user in Linux always has UID (from the environment variable $UID to 0.

if [ "$UID" -eq "$ROOT_UID" ] compares the current user's UID from the environment variable $UID to 0. 


then, else, if are conditional statements that print different messages depending on whether the UID matches root.

exit 0 exits the script sucessfully (status code 0). Any code after this will not executed. 

username=\ id -nu '' stores the current username (alternative method to $UID)

echo prints messages to the terminal.
id -nu returns the username of the corrent user. 

whoami is another command that prints the current username.
 
UID (user ID) is a numerical identifier assigned to each user.
