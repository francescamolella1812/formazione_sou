# Explanation of the script : "Naked Variables"

This Bash script demonstrates the concept of naked variables that is, when a variable appears without the $ symbol in front of it. 
It shows how variables are assigned, updated, and used in different contexts such as 'let' , 'for', and 'read'.

In bash, variables can either be: assigned a value, written without $; referenced, written with $

In this script, 'let' built-in Bash command to perform arithmetic operations

for cycle iterates through a list, assigning each element to loop variable. 

read reads user inout form standard input and assigns it to a variable. 

$variable expands the variables' current value. 
variable=value assign a new value without $
